<h3 id="brief">Brief</h3>

<p>WeddingSpot is a search tool that allows newly-engaged couples to browse and price wedding venues, and was recently acquired by Honeybook.</p>

<p>The primary aim for this project was to map out the user journey throughout the WeddingSpot tool and identify the breakpoints that were leading to user dropoff and determine the reasons for the aforementioned. The secondary aim for the project was to simplify the Wedding Venue Cost estimation tool for WeddingSpot by removing parameters that were not of major significance to the estimation result.</p>

<div id="2" markdown="1"><h2 id="theproblem">The Problem</h2></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>How might we educate the user on how to use WS to reduce negative feelings associated with venue searching?</p>
  
  <p>How might we present and receive the most important information to and from the user to make an accurate estimate?</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="3" markdown="1"><h2 id="theintendedprocess">The Intended Process</h2></div>

<ul>
<li><p>Conduct a market analysis to determine important functions, onboarding strategies, UX features, and aesthetics guidelines.        </p></li>

<li><p>Use sketching and digital wireframing to establish rudimentary information architecture and interaction flows.</p></li>

<li><p>User test wireframes in order to get design insight and substantiation and incorporate user testing feedback into the wireframes.</p></li>

<li><p>Develop wireframes into working prototypes, and conduct A/B testing on the system in order to observe change in metrics from the undertaken UX and onboarding strategies.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="4" markdown="1"><h2 id="userresearch">User Research</h2></div>

<h3 id="discussionguide">Discussion Guide</h3>

<p>The scope of the project was to explore the needs of a common end user when it came to curiosity about blockchain and devise the best user interactions to grasp concepts through data visualization</p>

<p>Areas we wanted to investigate: areas that users are curious about, commonplace/daily life parallels to those areas, and UI of the educational tool.</p>

<h3 id="dataanalyticsanduserinterviews">Data Analytics and User Interviews</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>We synthesized HoneyBook's existing Google Analytics data and LookBack user tests and used the aforementioned for developing discussion guides, researching competitors, designing a SurveyMonkey questionnaire for couples in the venue search process, and conducting user interviews. </p></li>

<li><p>From HoneyBook's previous user tests with the current Wedding-Spot framework, we established that couples are anxious and overwhelmed by the user journey. Additionally, we identified that there was no existing method of getting the user acquanited with the varied elements of the WeddingSpot website and for users who have little to no information about their Wedding preferences yet (which is the case for most casual browsers) - there is no motivation to fill out and interact with the varied estimation tools offered by the system.</p></li>

<li><p>We saw design opportunities to ideate on an effective onboarding flow and organization of the Spot Estimate tool, and launched a SurveyMonkey to learn about who our users were, what their pain points were, where they were in the venue search process and why they experience different feelings throughout the process.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="5" markdown="1"><h2 id="researchinsights">Research Insights</h2></div>

<h3 id="keyinsights">Key Insights</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Different couples care about, know, seek out different things, and are willing to put in different amounts of effort at different points in their search journeys.</p></li>

<li><p>Images are hugely important to get users to next step of process (to click to profile page, to request appt, etc) .</p></li>

<li><p>The Spot Estimate serves as a “mental checklist” that educates the user, but the SE is not the right place to surface that educational information</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="6" markdown="1"><h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2></div>

<p>A primary goal from the UX redesign was to create an effective onboarding experience for first time users rather then simply setting them free onto an unfamiliar page. This required identifying parts of the system that puzzled the users and building an onboarding experience tailored to those systems.</p>

<h3 id="datapointstargetedbytheonboarding">Datapoints Targeted By the Onboarding</h3>

<p>Here's a list of features targeted by the onboarding system:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Acquaint the user with the key feature of Wedding Spot - The Spot Estimate</p></li>

<li><p>Inform the user about the usage and metrics of data inputs required by the user</p></li>

<li><p>Ask the user to fill in certain pivotal data points thereby tailoring their web experience based on the inputted parameters.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="7" markdown="1"><h2 id="userflow">User Flow</h2></div>

<p>Next, We moved onto wireframing and mapping out the user interaction flows in order to simplify the confusion and reduce the user dropoff</p>

<div id="8" markdown="1"><h2 id="userflowinsights">User Flow Insights</h2></div>

<p>These user flows were tested with appropriate target audiences and the user tests led to the following conclusions:</p>

<h3 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Once users land on the site, they enter our onboarding process. The module features 3-4 pages that be exited at any time. These are the final layouts we decided to use in the pilot test.</p></li>

<li><p>The first iteration is informative with icons, while our second iteration is interactive with simple input fields.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="spotestimate">Spot Estimate</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>After completing the onboarding process, users land on the search result page. A tooltip appears to explain the budget range listed under each individual venue. Once they click into the venue profile page, users have the option to get an Instant Spot Estimate. This feature includes a live estimate based on 3 simple parameters.</p></li>

<li><p>To get a more accurate estimate, users have the option to click into a full Spot Estimate. Our first iteration uses an accordion style to organize the questions, with a live update on the right hand side based on the inputs selected. Our second iteration has similar features, but instead uses a tabular module to organize the questions.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="9" markdown="1"><h2 id="hifidelityprototypes">Hi Fidelity Prototypes</h2></div>

<p>We wanted our designs to resonate with  Weddingspot's brand identity which attributed to the selection of the red/pink color palette. Additionally, the minimal user interface enables the user to focus on the material being highlighted thereby offering an unhindered browsing experiece.</p>

<h3 id="onboardinghifidelityprototypes">Onboarding Hi-fidelity Prototypes.</h3>

							<div class="mar-top-lg">
								<div class="project-image"><img src="img/honeybook/hifi1.png" alt="insights" /></div>
							</div>
						</div>
					

<p>We also simplified the Spot Estimate Flow thereby minimizing the number of page redirects and user input boxes thus reducing the work required by a casual browser and thereby reducing user dropoff.</p>

<div id="10" markdown="1"><h2 id="usabilitytesting">Usability Testing</h2></div>

<p>We presented the final prototype to one of our interviewees and a few HoneyBook employees, all of whom were engaged, for A/B and pilot testing. Here are the key takeaways from the tests:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>For both of the onboarding flows, most users clicked out of the overlay screens before getting a chance to read through them.</strong> </p></li>

<li><p><strong>For both of the onboarding flows, most users clicked out of the overlay screens before getting a chance to read through them.</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>For both of the onboarding flows, most users clicked out of the overlay screens before getting a chance to read through them.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>We used this feedback to quickly pivot in the right direction and continued iterating on our designs.</p>

<div id="11" markdown="1"><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2></div>

<p>After synthesizing our insights from user testing, we considered potential future directions for this project and thought about aspects of our project that could be improved:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Users immediately wanted to exit out of both onboarding flows, so perhaps exploring an embedded onboarding experience (messages appearing after specific trigger events) would surface critical information only when relevant to the user.</p></li>

<li><p>The tooltips were not effective in drawing attention to explaining what the budget included, and therefore need further design exploration.</p></li>

<li><p>The Instant Spot Estimate imposes questions about how Wedding Spot positions itself to venues. Couples are now able to visit a venue after seeing a rough estimate, instead of an extremely accurate estimate.</p></li>
</ul>
