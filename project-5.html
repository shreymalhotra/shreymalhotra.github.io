<h3 id="brief">Brief</h3>

<p>Kolibree is a dental solutions company working on interactive toothbrushes that tracks the areas of the mouth that one is brushing and the one that one is ignoring. The primary aim for this project was to create an application that would work with a new low-cost toothbrush to enhance the brushing experience for kids through games and also help parents monitor the quality of their child's brushing. </p>

<p>This project was done through Berkeley Innovation, UC Berkeley's premiere human-centered design consultancy, in collaboration with the Kolibree's Twinkle project team.</p>

<div id="2" markdown="1"><h2 id="theproblem">The Problem</h2></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>How might we create a low cost system to track the areas of the mouth that kids are brush and the ones that they are ignoring?</p>
  
  <p>How might we introduce independance within kids when it comes to the task of brushing while at the same time ensuring remote parent progress tracking?</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="3" markdown="1"><h2 id="userresearch">User Research</h2></div>

<p>To better understand the product and the market, we conducted competitive analysis on other brands attempting a similar model. Initial Research and Competitive Analysis from our research on the products themselves and popular reviews we compiled some key points that we would keep in mind when we began designing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the brushing solution and app doesn't have some kind of replay value and changing characters/activities - the kids would get bored of it.</p></li>

<li><p>Kids would not want this app to be an educational application as the aim is to create incentive for independant brushing through the use of innovative and fun games.</p></li>

<li><p>The system needs to be user friendly to use as any complications would deter the child from using the application thereby deviating from the intended purpose of the product.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="4" markdown="1"><h2 id="userinterviews">User Interviews</h2></div>

<p>During our ten interviews, we sought to find out what were parents real objectives and challenges, and also find out more about what kids found to be fun. Here are some sample questions we used to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is your biggest goal when getting your child to brush their teeth?</p></li>

<li><p>What would you consider to be one of the most difficult parts of getting your children to brush their teeth?            </p></li>

<li><p>(to children) What are some of your favorite games to play on the phone? Why do you like them?</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="5" markdown="1"><h2 id="userinterviewinsights">User Interview Insights</h2></div>

<p>As we synthesized our findings, we gained the following key insights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All of the games mentioned by kids offered a reward system that sparked continued interest.    In order to keep kids engaged and have them receive value from the products, other games built in progression in a viral way. </p></li>

<li><p>Kids crave a feeling of advancing (being a "big kid")</p></li>

<li><p>Most parents cared more that kids actually brushed than they did about the quality.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="6" markdown="1"><h2 id="lofiprototyping">Lo Fi Prototyping</h2></div>

<p>We began by wireframing the flow of the app and the various screens that we might implement.</p>

								<div class="project-image"><img src="img/twinkle/prototyping.png" alt="insights" /></div>
							</div>
						</div>

<p>We decided to split the app into two partitions - this way the parent could have secure access to more information without risking the child getting lost in it and becoming frustrated.</p>

<h3 id="aduallevelandstarcurrencysystem">A dual level and "star" currency system.</h3>

<p>This would give children satisfaction through passive advancement (in the form of levels) and active advancement (being able to decide what they wanted to purchase). Items that they purchase could be used to customize selfies taken at the end of the daily brushing.</p>

						</div>

<p>All kid screens would use minimal text and large buttons to reduce the chance of confusion.Additionally, the parental dashboard would have a main screen with recent and relevant information. This would allow parents quick access to how their children have been brushing, with older data being available in the calendar.</p>

<div id="8" markdown="1"><h2 id="usertestinganditeration">User Testing and Iteration</h2></div>

<p>We conducted six in-person usability tests with parents and kids at a nearby WalMart. From our tests we discovered some important issues, which we addressed in our high fidelity iteration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many of the parents in our target demographic did not speak English as a first language. We added a screen to enable different languages so that the application could be accessible by more communities. </li>
</ul>

<div class="col-md-12">
							<div class="mar-top-lg">
								<div class="project-image"><img src="img/twinkle/h1.png" alt="insights" /></div>
							</div>
						</div>

<p>Our main menu, which separated child from parent screens, was not easily recognized as such and didn't feel like the launch point we intended it to be.To better fit the model that we intended, we devised an up/down swipe menu to add a degree of intention to the user's route.</p>

<div class="col-md-12">
							<div class="mar-top-lg">
								<div class="project-image"><img src="img/twinkle/h2.png" alt="insights" /></div>
							</div>
						</div>

<p>Kids didn't understand why they couldn't just get any item (some were disabled until a certain level). We decided that star currency was adequate for fulfilling a sense of progression, and made all items available to promote a sense of independence.</p>

<div class="col-md-12">
							<div class="mar-top-lg">
								<div class="project-image"><img src="img/twinkle/h3.png" alt="insights" /></div>
							</div>
						</div>

<p>Parents remarked that they may not use the application because they felt too "removed" from the experience. To bring parents back into the experience we reduced the number of stars given from playing the games and made it so the parent could choose to reward their child for good brushing.</p>

<p>This also allows the parents a chance to inform their child on spots they are missing and to open conversations on good hygiene.</p>

<div id="10" markdown="1"><h2 id="uielements">UI Elements</h2></div>

<p>Twinke appeals to the target audience of 5-12 year olds through colorful and bold design that is playful and exciting. We chose a bunny as the logo as it's a friendly animal that is known for its long and shiny front teeth. An animal logo provides an engaging mascot that kids of all ages can relate to.</p>
